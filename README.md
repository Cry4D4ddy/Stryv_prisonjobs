This is a script that allows jailed people to do work for some recources. 
This script was made for use on the QBOX framework and is highly customisable.

dependencies:
- ox_lib
- ox_target
- ox_inventory
- qbx_core

some extra script info:

u have 4 jobs 
- cleaning the yard
- gardening
- dishwashing
- cooking

The yard and Gardening job have a cooldown once u succesfully do the first job. this is so u do not get to much loot 
in a small time. 

some things may still be in dutch because i accidentally posted my version and not my english version.
but everything should be easy to replace to english without using google translate.
